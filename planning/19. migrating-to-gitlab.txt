Check Current Git Configuration for Credential Helper
To see which credential helper is currently configured, run:

bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper
Fixing the Configuration
If you want to use manager-core (the more secure option):

Remove the store configuration:

bash
Copy code
git config --global --unset credential.helper
Set manager-core again:

bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
If Using Credential Store:
If you prefer to use store, you should have a .git-credentials file in your home directory after running the store command. This file will contain your credentials in plain text:

Set credentials using the store method:

bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper store
Push Your Changes:

The next time you push, Git will prompt you for your username and password or token once, then save it to .git-credentials. After that, it will not prompt you again:

bash
Copy code
git push gitlab main
When you do this, Git will save your credentials in plain text to ~/.git-credentials. This method is less secure but will work if the credential manager is not an option.

Test the Configuration
After setting up the correct credential helper:

Try to push again:

bash
Copy code
git push gitlab main
If everything is set up correctly, Git should no longer prompt you for credentials, and your push will proceed without issue.
