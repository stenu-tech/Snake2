1. Project Setup
1.1 Set Up the Development Environment
Task: Ensure that all developers have the necessary tools and environments set up for Django development.

Steps:

Install Python: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on all developer machines.
Set Up Virtual Environments: Use venv or virtualenv to create isolated Python environments.
Install Django: Install Django using pip (pip install django).
Set Up IDE: Configure Visual Studio Code (or your preferred IDE) with necessary extensions (e.g., Python, Django, Git integration).
Configure Git: Set up version control with Git, and create a new repository on GitHub or another version control platform.
Assignee: DevOps Engineer, Developers

Duration: 1-2 days

1.2 Initialize the Django Project
Task: Create a new Django project to serve as the foundation for your game development.

Steps:

Create Django Project: Run django-admin startproject snake_game to create a new project.
Set Up Initial Applications: Within the project, create Django apps for different features, such as gameplay, users, and leaderboard.
Configure Settings: Adjust the settings.py to configure databases, static files, and any other necessary settings.
Run Initial Migrations: Run python manage.py migrate to set up the database schema.
Assignee: Lead Developer

Duration: 1-2 days

2. Development Kickoff
2.1 Begin Development with XP Practices
Task: Start implementing user stories with a focus on Test-Driven Development (TDD) and pair programming.

Steps:

Create User Stories: Review the user stories defined during the planning phase and prioritize them.
Implement Initial Features: Begin with core features like game initialization and basic snake movement. Write tests first (TDD) and then implement the functionality.
Pair Programming: Encourage developers to work in pairs to write and review code together.
Continuous Integration: Set up CI pipelines (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automate testing and code integration.
Assignee: Developers

Duration: 1-2 weeks per iteration

2.2 Set Up the Database
Task: Design and implement the database schema required for storing user data, game states, and leaderboard information.

Steps:

Design Schema: Define models in Django for users, game sessions, scores, etc.
Implement Models: Create the models in Django and run migrations.
Integrate with Admin Interface: Utilize Django’s admin interface for managing game data during development.
Assignee: Developers

Duration: 1 week

3. Testing Strategy Implementation
3.1 Develop and Automate Tests
Task: Write unit tests and integration tests as part of the development process.

Steps:

Write Unit Tests: Develop unit tests for individual components and models.
Automate Testing: Use Django’s built-in testing framework and integrate with CI pipelines for automated testing.
Integration Tests: Write integration tests to ensure that different parts of the application work together seamlessly.
Assignee: Developers, Testers

Duration: Ongoing

3.2 Perform Manual and Exploratory Testing
Task: Begin manual testing of the initial features as they are developed.

Steps:

Create Test Cases: Develop test cases based on the defined BDD scenarios.
Execute Manual Tests: Perform manual testing, especially focusing on edge cases and usability.
Document Issues: Use a task management tool to document any issues or bugs found during manual testing.
Assignee: Testers

Duration: Ongoing with each iteration

4. Design and Prototyping
4.1 Develop UI/UX Prototypes
Task: Continue to refine UI/UX designs for the game based on initial feedback and requirements.

Steps:

Create Prototypes: Develop interactive prototypes for the game's user interface using tools like Figma or Adobe XD.
Review and Iterate: Gather feedback from stakeholders and iterate on the design.
Implement UI: Once approved, begin implementing the UI components in Django, using Django templates or integrating with front-end frameworks if needed.
Assignee: UX/UI Designer, Front-End Developer

Duration: 1-2 weeks

5. Coordination and Agile Practices
5.1 Conduct Daily Stand-Ups
Task: Hold daily stand-up meetings to keep the team aligned and address any blockers.

Steps:

Discuss Progress: Team members briefly discuss what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any obstacles.
Identify Blockers: Address any immediate issues that are blocking progress.
Update Task Board: Ensure the task board (e.g., in Jira or Trello) is updated with the latest status.
Assignee: Scrum Master or Project Manager

Duration: Daily, 15 minutes

5.2 Sprint Planning and Retrospectives
Task: Plan and review iterations regularly to ensure progress is aligned with project goals.

Steps:

Sprint Planning: At the beginning of each sprint, plan the tasks and user stories that will be completed.
Retrospectives: After each sprint, hold a retrospective to discuss what went well, what could be improved, and how to implement changes.
Assignee: Scrum Master or Project Manager

Duration: Sprint Planning (1-2 hours), Retrospective (1 hour) per sprint

6. Deployment and Post-Deployment
6.1 Prepare for Deployment
Task: Finalize the codebase and prepare the application for deployment.

Steps:

Finalize Code: Complete all pending tasks and ensure that all features are thoroughly tested.
Review and Merge: Perform final code reviews and merge all feature branches into the main branch.
Deploy: Deploy the application to the target environment (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
Assignee: Developers, DevOps Engineer

Duration: 1 week

6.2 Post-Deployment Monitoring
Task: Monitor the application post-deployment and address any issues that arise.

Steps:

Monitor Logs: Use logging tools to monitor the application's performance and errors.
Handle Bugs: Fix any bugs reported by users or detected during post-deployment testing.
Release Updates: Implement updates and patches as needed based on feedback.
Assignee: Developers, Testers

Duration: 2 weeks post-launch

Next Steps Summary:
Set Up Development Environment: Install Python, Django, and configure tools.
Initialize Django Project: Create the project structure and initial applications.
Begin Development: Implement user stories using TDD and pair programming.
Develop and Automate Tests: Write and automate unit and integration tests.
Design and Implement UI/UX: Develop and refine the game’s user interface.
Coordination: Conduct daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.
Deployment: Prepare the application for deployment and monitor post-launch.
Following these steps will ensure a smooth development process, aligning with both Extreme Programming and ISTQB testing methodologies while leveraging Python and Django for efficient, scalable game development.
