Testing Pyramid for the Classic Game of Snake
The testing pyramid is a visual representation of different levels of testing, emphasizing the importance of a strong foundation of lower-level tests (unit tests) and a smaller set of high-level tests (UI/End-to-End tests). This pyramid is tailored based on the estimation plan, BDD model, and test plan for the Classic Game of Snake.

1. Unit Testing (Foundation Level)
Purpose: To test individual components and functions in isolation.
Scope:
Snake movement logic
Collision detection
Score calculation
Growth after consuming food
Procedural generation logic
AI decision-making processes
AR components in isolation
Tools: xUnit, NUnit, JUnit, or similar
Frequency: High
Effort Allocation: ~50% of total testing effort
Automation: Fully automated
Example Tests:

Verify that the snake grows by one unit after consuming food.
Test that the game over condition triggers upon collision.
Ensure that procedural generation produces unique grids.
2. Integration Testing (Middle Layer)
Purpose: To test interactions between integrated units or components.
Scope:
Interaction between movement logic and collision detection
Multiplayer synchronization
AI behavior in response to player actions
AR integration with gameplay
Score updates with visual feedback
Tools: Selenium, Cypress, Postman (for API integration), or similar
Frequency: Medium
Effort Allocation: ~30% of total testing effort
Automation: Semi-automated, with critical paths automated
Example Tests:

Test that multiplayer mode correctly synchronizes snake movements across players.
Verify that score updates accurately reflect the gameplay state.
Ensure that AI adjustments work consistently across different game sessions.
3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing (Top Layer)
Purpose: To validate the entire application flow, from start to finish, as it would be used by an end user.
Scope:
Starting and playing the game from launch to game over
Multiplayer session initiation and completion
AR experience from game start to end
Game deployment on different platforms
Tools: Cypress, Selenium, Appium (for mobile), or similar
Frequency: Low
Effort Allocation: ~10% of total testing effort
Automation: Selective automation, with critical paths covered
Example Tests:

Verify that the game starts, runs, and ends correctly on all targeted platforms.
Test the complete flow of a multiplayer session.
Validate the AR experience from initialization to game over.
4. Manual and Exploratory Testing (Cross-Cutting Concern)
Purpose: To catch issues that automated tests may miss, focusing on the user experience, unexpected behavior, and edge cases.
Scope:
Usability testing across various platforms
Exploring edge cases in gameplay scenarios
Testing UI/UX aspects
Tools: None specific; relies on QA expertise
Frequency: Continuous, especially during late development and pre-release stages
Effort Allocation: ~10% of total testing effort
Automation: None, manual effort only
Example Tests:

Explore unusual inputs to ensure the game handles them gracefully.
Assess the usability of the game interface across different devices.
Test edge cases such as maximum snake length or rapidly changing direction.
