Risk Assessment: Probability and impact analysis for each risk.
Mitigation Strategies: Steps to minimize or respond to each identified risk.
Contingency Plans: What to do if a risk becomes a reality.
Audience: Project Manager, Developers, Stakeholders.
4. System Architecture Document
Purpose: To describe the overall architecture of the application, including the components, their interactions, and the technology stack.
Content:
Overview: High-level architecture diagram.
Components: Detailed descriptions of each component (e.g., Django apps, database, API layer).
Data Flow: How data moves through the system.
Integration Points: How different systems or services interact.
Scalability and Performance Considerations: How the architecture supports scalability and performance.
Audience: Lead Developer, Developers, DevOps Engineers.
5. Test Plan
Purpose: To detail the testing strategy, including what will be tested, how it will be tested, and who will conduct the testing.
Content:
Testing Scope: Features and functionalities to be tested.
Test Types: Unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and acceptance tests.
Test Environment: Description of the environments where testing will take place (e.g., local, staging).
Test Cases: Detailed test cases derived from user stories and requirements.
Roles and Responsibilities: Who is responsible for writing, executing, and reviewing tests.
Timeline: When testing will occur during the project lifecycle.
Audience: Testers, Developers, Project Manager.
6. Deployment Plan
Purpose: To outline the steps required to deploy the application to production, including preparation, execution, and post-deployment activities.
Content:
Pre-Deployment Checklist: Necessary actions before deployment (e.g., code review, testing).
Deployment Steps: Detailed steps to deploy the application (e.g., pushing to Heroku, running migrations).
Rollback Plan: Actions to take if something goes wrong during deployment.
Post-Deployment Monitoring: Tools and methods for monitoring the application after deployment.
Stakeholder Communication: Who needs to be informed about the deployment and how.
Audience: DevOps Engineer, Developers, Project Manager.
7. User Documentation
Purpose: To provide end-users with instructions on how to use the application.

User Guide: Step-by-step instructions on how to use the application.
Feature Overview: Description of the game’s features.
FAQs: Common questions and their answers.
Support Information: How users can get help if needed.
Audience: End-Users, Support Team.
8. Post-Mortem Report Template
Purpose: To review what went well, what didn’t, and how the team can improve after each major milestone or at the end of the project.
Content:
Successes: What aspects of the project were successful.
Challenges: What issues arose and how they were handled.
Lessons Learned: Key takeaways for future projects.
Action Items: Specific actions to be taken in future projects to avoid similar challenges.
Audience: Entire Project Team.
Recommendation: Start with the Detailed Sprint Plan
If your team is moving into active development, a Detailed Sprint Plan would be the most immediate next step. This document will guide your team through the initial development sprints, ensuring that everyone is aligned on priorities, tasks, and goals. After that, consider creating the System Architecture Document to solidify your technical foundation.
