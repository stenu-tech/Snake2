Example Workflow:
yaml
Copy code
name: Django CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        python manage.py test
Pair Programming

Tool: VS Code Live Share
Purpose: Enables pair programming by allowing multiple developers to work on the same codebase in real-time.
Installation: Install the Live Share extension in Visual Studio Code.
3. Database Management
Tools:
PostgreSQL

Purpose: A robust, open-source relational database management system for storing game data.
Installation: Install via PostgreSQL's website.
Usage: Configure Django to use PostgreSQL by modifying settings.py:
python
Copy code
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'snake_game',
        'USER': 'your_username',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
Django Admin Interface

Purpose: Manage database content during development (e.g., users, game states, leaderboard).
Usage: Access via /admin route after creating a superuser with:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
4. Testing and Continuous Integration
Tools:
PyTest

Purpose: A testing framework for writing and running tests in Django.
Installation:
bash
Copy code
pip install pytest pytest-django
Usage: Write test cases in files named test_*.py and run them with:
bash
Copy code
pytest
Coverage.py

Purpose: Measures code coverage in testing, ensuring that all code paths are tested.
Installation:
bash
Copy code
pip install coverage
Usage:
bash
Copy code
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report
Selenium

Purpose: Automate browser testing to ensure that the user interface works as expected.
Installation:
bash
Copy code
pip install selenium
Usage: Write Selenium tests to simulate user interactions.
GitHub Actions (for CI)

Purpose: Automatically run tests and check code quality on every push or pull request.
Setup: Integrate with GitHub as shown in the example workflow above.
5. Design and UI/UX Prototyping
Tools:
Figma

Purpose: Design tool for creating wireframes and interactive UI/UX prototypes.
Usage: Use Figma’s collaborative features to iterate on design with stakeholders.
Django Templates

Purpose: Render dynamic HTML content in the Django application.
Usage: Use Django’s templating engine to create views that integrate with the designed UI.
Bootstrap

Purpose: A front-end framework for creating responsive, mobile-first interfaces.
Installation:
Via CDN: Add the Bootstrap CSS and JS links in your base template.
Usage: Use Bootstrap classes to style your Django templates.
6. Deployment and Post-Deployment Monitoring
Tools:
Heroku

Purpose: Cloud platform for deploying and managing the Django application.
Setup:
Create a Procfile: Defines the application’s entry point.
Procfile
Copy code
web: gunicorn snake_game.wsgi --log-file -
Deploy to Heroku: Push the codebase to Heroku using Git.
New Relic

Purpose: Monitor the application's performance and identify bottlenecks or errors.
Setup: Integrate New Relic with Django by adding the New Relic agent and configuring it in the settings.py.
Sentry

Purpose: Monitor and log errors in production, with automated alerts.
Setup: Integrate with Django by installing the Sentry SDK.
bash
Copy code
pip install sentry-sdk
